#### About

This project is conducted as part of [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) compulsory projects. The goal of the project is to test my understanding of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for text generation. In order to finish the project, I did the following activities:
1. Punctuation Tokenization
2. Word Vectorization
3. Build an RNN
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
